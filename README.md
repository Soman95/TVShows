So here I tried to simulate a sort of search engine for TV shows, that returns the images of shows with the associated keyword provided in the input. I actually found this quite fun to make, and I discovered a new show I want to watch throug it...Person of Interest looks like my next watch!

API utilisation and async functions were core to the functionality of this. I found DOM manipulation to be especially useful for the 'reset' feature when beginning a new search.
